## Accounts / Vaults

2/ The Idea:
What if you could create multiple accounts/vaults within a single wallet, each dedicated to specific risk levels or strategies?
ðŸ’¡ Imagine:

- A "Safe" vault for long-term holds.
- A "High-Risk" vault for leveraged plays.


## Strategies:

In case of AAVE, the balance of the lending/borrowing tokens increase over time.

Example
Keeper - 10 days
- Automate reward to repay yield
- Automate reward to buy other kind of assets

A vault can have MULTIPLE STRATEGIES


How to reduce entry barrier
=> Do not want to pay fees for each market action

// FIXME: Front-end side --> Show all the history for all the action of the vault!
